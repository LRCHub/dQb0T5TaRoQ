You thought you just had a bit
But suddenly you just got a hit
With feelings getting out of control
A temperature of burning coal

You feel sick - sick - sick and sicker
And you think your tounge is thicker
Your champagne glas breaks, look at the mess
You swear next time, "I take less"

The party must go on without you
You gotta get out of this human zoo
Clinking glasses, your head starts to swell
All this noise brings you in hell

People wonder, what's in your crazy mind
But you don't care, you left this world behind
You talk of glories, that are not true
Thinking people have no clue

The party must go on without you
You gotta get out of this human zoo
Clinking glasses, your head starts to swell
All this noise brings you in hell

You should go home before it gets obscene
You swear next time I stay clean
And endless price you have to pay
For trying to have fun today

The party must go on without you
You gotta get out of this human zoo
Clinking glasses, your head starts to swell
All this noise brings you in hell
